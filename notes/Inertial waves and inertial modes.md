# Inertial waves and inertial modes
- The terms *inertial waves* and *inertial modes* are used in different ways in the literature in order to denote the solution to [[PoincareÃÅ equation]].
- Mathematically speaking, the term *mode* denotes a member of a (possibly infinite) set of solutions to a differential problem that forms a complete basis upon which any arbitrary solution can be expanded. These modes must satisfy a series of conditions such as being orthogonal (or orthogonalisable) to each other. They are the analog to bases of eigenvectors of linear algebra in functional analysis.
- Physicists and engineers tend to use the term *mode* much more loosely to denote global oscillatory solutions of a differential problem in a closed region of space. 
- Physicists can then refer to solutions to the Navier-Stokes equation in the internal fluid layers of rotating planets as *inertial modes* even when visosity is present *even though* there is no formal proof that these solutions form a complete flow basis.

- If we insist on using the term *mode* only in the mathematical sense, then we might be condemned of not being allowed to use it to denote any actually observed oscillations at all. Indeed, in practice, ideal mathematical modes almost always appear distorted by imperfections caused by practical conditions such as a non-zero viscosity for the case of inertial modes.
